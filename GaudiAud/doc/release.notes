Package: GaudiAud
Package manager : David Quarrie

================ GaudiAud v8r7 ====================================
! 2008-11-10 - Charles Leggett
 - Patch #2183. Link to Atlas error policy in AlgErrorAuditor

! 2008-10-02 - Charles Leggett
 - Patch #1939. Allow auditors to catch CustomEventTypes

================ GaudiAud v8r6 ====================================
! 2008-05-13 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed compilation problem introduced with patch #1756.
   Explicit include of IChronoStatSvc.h was needed in ChronoAuditor.cpp.

================ GaudiAud v8r5 ====================================
! 2007-03-11 - Charles Leggett
 - Patch #1717. Audit memory at initialize time.
   Uncommented the function to get the memory utilization after initialize (in
   MemStatAuditor).

================ GaudiAud v8r4 ====================================
! 2007-11-13 - Charles Leggett
 - bug #28570.
   Modified AlgContextAuditor to avoid that it passes a null pointer to
   AlgContextSvc. It happens if the AuditorSvc is auditing objects that inherit
   from INamedInterface, but not from IAlgorithm (e.g. services).  

! 2007-11-13 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added a test to expose bug #28570.

!==============v8r3==========================================================
! 2007-08-06 - Vanya Belyaev
 - patch #1231. Added explicit include IChronoStatSvc.h in MemStatAuditor.cpp
   
!==============v8r2==========================================================
! 2007-05-24 - Vanya Belyaev
 - patch #1171. The enhancement of existing Algorithm Context Service
   is the primary goal of the proposed patch. The existing
   AlgContextSvc is not safe with respect to e.g. Data-On-Demand
   service or to operations with subalgorithms. The patched service
   essentially implements the queue of executing algorithms, thus the
   problems are eliminiated. In addition the enriched interface
   provides the access to the whole queue of executing algorithms.

! 2007-05-11 - Charles Leggett
 - patch #1150. If the AlgErrAuditor detects that an illegal
   StatusCode/MessageStream combination has been issued by an
   Algorithm, an exception or an abort() can be thrown, configured by
   a jobOpt. Also prints out summaries at the end of the job of
   illegal combination.

! 2007-04-27 - Sebatien Binet
 - patch #25889. Fixed uninitialized private members of AlgErrorAuditor.

!==============v8r1==========================================================
! 2007-01-18 - Charles Leggett
 patch #972. 
 - add messageCount to IMessageSvc
 - extend Auditor::(sys)afterExecute to pass a const StatusCode&,
   which is the return code of the algorithm
 - new auditor to monitor algorithms, issue message if algorithm
   writes out an ERROR or FATAL, but returns SUCCESS
	
!==============v8r0==========================================================
! 2007-01-12 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - bug #22799. changed the return value of chronoStart, chronoStop,
   chronoPrint, stat and statPrint method of the IChronoStatSvc from
   StatusCode to void.

! 2006-12-13 - Charles Leggett
 - instrumented auditors for reinitialize, beginRun, endRun

! 2006-11-30 - Pere Mato
  Adapted package to the new PluginSvc
  - Removed protected from constructor/destructors and friendship of
    Factory class

!==============v7r2==========================================================
! 2006-09-21 Hubert Degaudenzi
 - use of the DECLARE macros for the auditor factories.

! 2006-09-13 Charles Leggett and Hubert Degaudenzi
 - added AlgContextAuditor (remove from GaudiSvc)

!==============v7r1==========================================================
! 2006-04-13 Charles Leggett and Hubert Degaudenzi
 - inserted ATLAS feature INamedInterface.

!==============v7r0==========================================================
! 2006-03-15 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - replaced the returned StatusCode with void for before*/after*
   methods of auditors. Interface changed.

!==============v6r6==========================================================
! 2006-01-27 - Pere Mato
 - Use the compoment_library pattern

!==============v6r5==========================================================
! 2004-06-08 - Pere Mato
- ProcStats.h(.cpp) Fixed [bugs #3667] bytes to Mbytes conversion in ProcStats.cpp

!==============v6r4==========================================================
! 2004-01-15 - Pere Mato
- Added changes from ATLAS (Paolo et al.)


!==============v6r3==========================================================
! 2004-01-07 - David Rousseau
- MemStatAuditor::printinfo: don't return when p->fetch(info) is false

! 2003-11-06 - David Rousseau
- radically change the philosophy of MemStatAuditor: MemStatAuditor
    now accumulate the incremental change of memory usage during the job.
  Only VSize is monitored (RSS is less reproducible).
  This allows to spot in which algorithm memory leak happen

! 2003-11-26 - Pere Mato
 - Small changes for Mac OSX (Guy Barrand)
!==============v6r2==========================================================
! 2003-01-06 - Sebastien Ponce
 - better support for gcc 3.2

!==============v6r1==========================================================
! 2002-09-24 - Pere Mato
 - Changes to clean the reference counting and memory deallocation
   detected by the "valgrind" tool. Changed failes: ChronoAuditor.cpp (.h)
 - requirements: use v* 

!==============v6r0p1=========================================================
! 2002-09-23 - Flr
 - requirements - use GaudiKernel v*

!=============================================================================
!20010508 - Pere Mato
 - Using GaudiKernel v10

!=============================================================================
!20010206 - Pere Mato
- New Auditor MemStatAuditor made by I. Belyaev added to the package

!20001025 - GaudiAud v1 -David Quarrie
- This package contains concrete Auditors. An Auditor monitors some resource
  on a per-Algorithm basis. It performs this monitoring by calls immediately
  before and after the appropriate initialize, execute and finalize calls.

  Initial implementations are:

  NameAuditor   This is a diagnostic tool that just displays the name of
                each Algorithm.

  ChronoAuditor This displays at the end of job the total and per event
                cpu time taken by each Algorithm.

  MemoryAuditor This warns of possible memory leaks. However, Algorithms
                that register objects with the transient event store will
                cause this warning to be triggered. It is designed to
                warn of memory leaks from Algorithms that retrieve objects
                from the transient event store.
